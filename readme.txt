jojo_cart_paymex_pro
====================

Update 17th September 2008:
Paymex have gone out of business. Here is the notice.
________________________________
As at 1:45pm 17th September 2008 Paymex has unfortunately had to close it's doors. Due to some runaway chargebacks and various legal issues we've been subsequently forced to stop trading.

Those of you that had money in your Paymex account will have it withdrawn automatically from our system to be scheduled for deposit into your nominated account. In saying this, it is now up to our bank (BNZ) to make payments. This may take up to a week to sort out.

We wish you all the best of luck, and also apologise for any inconveniance this has caused.
